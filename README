Minecraft Server Manager
------------------------
Developed and Maintained by Eloston

Minecraft Server Manager is a 'wrapper' around your Minecraft server. It will present itself as a server to incomming clients when your server is not running, and will startup your server when a client tries to connect.

Any version of Minecraft will work, as long as the protocol does not vary greately from the current version (as of the time of this writing, 1.4.6)

Currently the Manager supports:
-Reading from a white-list and kicking non-whitelisted players off
-Reading from server.properties to present information in a server ping
-Configuration file in a separate .ini file that can be reloaded at any time (See config.ini for a template)
-GUI

Software Requirements:
-Python 3.x
-PySide for Python 3 (Possibly PyQt with slight modifications)
-Any platform that meets the requirements above (however this is untested under other platforms except Linux)

This software is licensed under the GPLv3. For a copy of the license, see COPYING.
