Minecraft Server Manager
------------------------
Developed and Maintained by Eloston

Minecraft Server Manager is a 'super-server' (like inetd) for Minecraft servers. It will listen on the server's port, and start the server when someone tries to connect. The port will be released by this manager, and the server will take over. It is up to the server to shut down once it starts running (e.g. a Bukkit server with an auto-shutdown plugin)

This application currently supports Minecraft 1.8.x

Currently the Manager supports:
-On-demand reloading of configuration files
-Checking users against the server's whitelist
-Offline-mode button to stop any user from joining
-Graphical Interface

Using Minecraft Server Manager:
-Make sure your current working directory is that of the Minecraft server
-Launch the manager

Software Requirements:
-Python 3.x
-PySide for Python 3
-Any platform that meets the requirements above
